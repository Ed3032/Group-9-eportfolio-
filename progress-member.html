            <p>During this week, our team made significant progress on both the design and electrical aspects of the IETP project. We held scheduled meetings to review our tasks, organize upcoming work, and ensure alignment among team members.

                    SolidWorks Progress:
                    The SolidWorks model of our system was completed. After presenting it to our advisor, we received important feedback. The advisor recommended replacing the stainless-steel components with a more cost-effective material. This change must be reflected not only in the SolidWorks model but also in the written project proposal.

                    Electrical Circuit:
                    The electrical circuit design was successfully completed. All required components were arranged and tested in the design phase, and the circuit is ready for integration with the mechanical model.

                    Advisor Feedback & Next Steps:

                    - Update SolidWorks model by replacing stainless steel with a cheaper material.
                    - Adjust the proposal to reflect the material changes.
                    - Re-submit updated designs for advisor review next week.

                    General Team Activities:

                    - Conducted team meetings to assess progress.
                    - Discussed adjustments needed and assigned responsibilities for revisions.

                    Overall Status:
                    The project is progressing well, with completed designs in both mechanical and electrical areas. Upcoming tasks focus on refinement and cost optimization.

This change must be reflected not only in the SolidWorks model but also in the written project proposal.

                    Electrical Circuit:
                    The electrical circuit design was successfully completed. All required components were arranged and tested in the design phase, and the circuit is ready for integration with the mechanical model.

                    Advisor Feedback & Next Steps:

                    - Update SolidWorks model by replacing stainless steel with a cheaper material.
                    - Adjust the proposal to reflect the material changes.
                    - Re-submit updated designs for advisor review next week.

                    General Team Activities:

                    - Conducted team meetings to assess progress.
                    - Discussed adjustments needed and assigned responsibilities for revisions.

                    Overall Status:
                    The project is progressing well, with completed designs in both mechanical and electrical areas. Upcoming tasks focus on refinement and cost optimization.
