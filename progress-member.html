            <p>First week was basically introductions and figuring out how to work as a team since we’re all from different departments. We spent time chatting, getting a feel for everyone’s schedules and skills, and swapping ideas on what we might want to tackle. Someone suggested checking out past IETP projects, so we scrolled through those to get a sense of what’s doable. Ended up creating a Telegram group to keep all our chats and files in one spot—way easier to stay organized.</p>

We also mapped out the backend tasks and set up a GitHub repo so we’re ready to start merging our work soon.</p>
