                    SolidWorks Progress:
                    The SolidWorks model of our system was completed. After presenting it to our advisor, we received important feedback. The advisor recommended replacing the stainless-steel components with a more cost-effective material. This change must be reflected not only in the SolidWorks model but also in the written project proposal.

                    Electrical Circuit:
                    The electrical circuit design was successfully completed. All required components were arranged and tested in the design phase, and the circuit is ready for integration with the mechanical model.

                    Advisor Feedback & Next Steps:

                    - Update SolidWorks model by replacing stainless steel with a cheaper material.
                    - Adjust the proposal to reflect the material changes.
                    - Re-submit updated designs for advisor review next week.

                    General Team Activities:

                    - Conducted team meetings to assess progress.

            <p>In the sixth week, our team concentrated on implementing the feedback provided by our project advisor related to the civil engineering components of the ITEP project. Revisions were made to the drainage layout and structural elements to improve constructability, durability, and cost efficiency. Material selections for the drainage channels and supporting structures were reviewed, and more practical alternatives were proposed based on local availability and site conditions. The project documentation was updated to reflect these design modifications, including changes in quantity estimation and preliminary cost analysis. After completing the revisions, the updated civil design drawings and written documents were resubmitted to our advisor for further evaluation.</p>
